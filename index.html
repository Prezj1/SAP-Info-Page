    <p><code>SAP</code> is one of the world’s leading producers of software for the management of business processes, developing solutions that facilitate effective data processing and information flow across organizations.</p>
    <p>Founded in 1972, the company was initially called System Analysis Program Development (Systemanalyse Programmentwicklung), later abbreviated to <code>SAP</code>. Since then, it has grown from a small, five-person endeavor to a multinational enterprise headquartered in Walldorf, Germany, with more than 101,000 employees worldwide</p>
    <p>With the introduction of its original <code>SAP R/2</code> and <code>SAP R/3</code> software, <code>SAP</code> established the global standard for enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. Now, <code>SAP S/4HANA</code> takes ERP to the next level by using the power of in-memory computing to process vast amounts of data, and to support advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.</p>
    <p>The company’s integrated applications connect all parts of a business into an intelligent suite on a fully digital platform, thereby replacing the process-driven, legacy platform. Today, SAP has more than 230 million cloud users, more than 100 solutions covering all business functions, and the largest cloud portfolio of any provider.</p>
    <p>Christian Klein (40) leads the company, heads up the Executive Board of SAP SE, and, at 40, is the youngest CEO of any major enterprise on Germany’s DAX blue chip market index.</p>
    <p>The name is an initialism of the company’s original German name: Systemanalyse Programmentwicklung, which translates to System Analysis Program Development.</p>
    <p>Today the company’s legal corporate name is <code>SAP SE</code> — SE stands for societas Europaea, a public company registered in accordance with the European Union corporate law.</p>
    <p>People often ask, “How do you say SAP?” It is an initialism, not an acronym, therefore, it is pronounced as individual letters (S-A-P). <code>SAP</code> is not pronounced as a word <code>(“sap”).</code></p>

  <li>Traditional business models often decentralize data management, with each business function storing its own operational data in a separate database.</li>
  <li>This makes it difficult for employees from different business functions to access each other’s information. Furthermore, duplication of data across multiple departments increases IT storage costs and the risk of data errors.</li>
  <li>By centralizing data management, <code>SAP</code> software provides multiple business functions with a single view of the truth</li>
  <li>This helps companies better manage complex business processes by giving employees of different departments easy access to real-time insights across the enterprise</li>
  <li>As a result, businesses can accelerate workflows, improve operational efficiency, raise productivity, enhance customer experiences – and ultimately increase profits.</li>

   <p>Top left corner; useful to stop a transaction that is taking too long, many users are only taught the icon to create a new session, but that will not work if the session is "busy" where the top left corner method will.</p>
   <p>You can set your SAP start transaction, in case you prefer to always start from a specific screen, such as my favorite, transaction code IH01 - Functional Location Structure. Menu Path: Extras > Set start transaction (this sets the standard logon default start screen).</p>
   <p>I call this next tip the '00 trick'. It's great to control the enormous SAP Menu. The first two letters of many tcodes have meaning; for example, IW is an abbreviation for "workflow," so if you type iw00, it changes the SAP Menu to only show workflow related transactions.</p>
   <p> Tcode to search Menu = "Search_SAP_Menu,". This can be useful to see what transactions refer to a keyword of interest, such as "project." It shows you all transactions containing that search word. Many people also use Google, and we often provide a list of all tcodes with descriptions as to what the transaction does, what role has access, and other useful tips.</p>
